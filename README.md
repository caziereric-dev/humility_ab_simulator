Humility-A/B Simulator (Browser Pyodide App)
A browser-based simulator implementing the Humility-Stabilized A/B test: Model A vs Model B with coherence sensing, abstention logic, torsion detection, and full ablation suite. Runs entirely client-side via Pyodide.

Features
	•	5-stratum dataset generator
	•	Model A baseline inference
	•	Model B humility-controlled inference
	•	Δσ, C_v1, and energy sensing
	•	τ_E calibration
	•	Abstain, dampen, exploit policies
	•	Complete ablation modes
	•	Full metrics report and JSON export
